    "Description": "A small village nestled between rolling hills, surrounded by a sturdy stone wall. The air is filled with the scent of fresh bread from the local bakery, and villagers bustle about their daily routines. Children play near a bubbling fountain in the center square, while farmers lead their livestock through winding cobblestone streets. Beyond the village, the forest looms to the north and the grand silhouette of a castle rises to the east.",
